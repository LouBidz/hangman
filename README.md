Things to note:

- Create your branch on your local repository and link it to your remote respository, don't forget to git init in your terminal to allow git to track.

- Always check the code, sometimes with the best intentions some instructions could be slighty out of sink! 
Don't give up, find the solution!

- Always remember to do this! git add <filename>,git commit -m "Your message" <filename> or if you want to sign your commits in Github git commit -S -m "Your message" 

- Try and put comments and docstrings into your code as you go along! it helps to back track if it goes wrong! :)
